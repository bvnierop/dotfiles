* Config
** Original config
This is the original config.el from Doom emacs. It's kept here in order to be
able to look things up.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;;; $DOOMDIR/config.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Place your private configuration here! Remember, you do not need to run 'doom
;; sync' after modifying this file!


;; Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email
;; clients, file templates and snippets. It is optional.
(setq user-full-name "Bart van Nierop"
      user-mail-address "mail@bvnierop.nl")

;; Doom exposes five (optional) variables for controlling fonts in Doom:
;;
;; - `doom-font' -- the primary font to use
;; - `doom-variable-pitch-font' -- a non-monospace font (where applicable)
;; - `doom-big-font' -- used for `doom-big-font-mode'; use this for
;;   presentations or streaming.
;; - `doom-unicode-font' -- for unicode glyphs
;; - `doom-serif-font' -- for the `fixed-pitch-serif' face
;;
;; See 'C-h v doom-font' for documentation and more examples of what they
;; accept. For example:
;;
;;(setq doom-font (font-spec :family "Fira Code" :size 12 :weight 'semi-light)
;;      doom-variable-pitch-font (font-spec :family "Fira Sans" :size 13))
;;
;; If you or Emacs can't find your font, use 'M-x describe-font' to look them
;; up, `M-x eval-region' to execute elisp code, and 'M-x doom/reload-font' to
;; refresh your font settings. If Emacs still can't find your font, it likely
;; wasn't installed correctly. Font issues are rarely Doom issues!

;; There are two ways to load a theme. Both assume the theme is installed and
;; available. You can either set `doom-theme' or manually load a theme with the
;; `load-theme' function. This is the default:
(setq doom-theme 'doom-one)

;; This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to `nil', line
;; numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to `relative'.
(setq display-line-numbers-type t)

;; If you use `org' and don't want your org files in the default location below,
;; change `org-directory'. It must be set before org loads!
(setq org-directory "~/org/")


;; Whenever you reconfigure a package, make sure to wrap your config in an
;; `after!' block, otherwise Doom's defaults may override your settings. E.g.
;;
;;   (after! PACKAGE
;;     (setq x y))
;;
;; The exceptions to this rule:
;;
;;   - Setting file/directory variables (like `org-directory')
;;   - Setting variables which explicitly tell you to set them before their
;;     package is loaded (see 'C-h v VARIABLE' to look up their documentation).
;;   - Setting doom variables (which start with 'doom-' or '+').
;;
;; Here are some additional functions/macros that will help you configure Doom.
;;
;; - `load!' for loading external *.el files relative to this one
;; - `use-package!' for configuring packages
;; - `after!' for running code after a package has loaded
;; - `add-load-path!' for adding directories to the `load-path', relative to
;;   this file. Emacs searches the `load-path' when you load packages with
;;   `require' or `use-package'.
;; - `map!' for binding new keys
;;
;; To get information about any of these functions/macros, move the cursor over
;; the highlighted symbol at press 'K' (non-evil users must press 'C-c c k').
;; This will open documentation for it, including demos of how they are used.
;; Alternatively, use `C-h o' to look up a symbol (functions, variables, faces,
;; etc).
;;
;; You can also try 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') to jump to their definition and see how
;; they are implemented.

** Quality of Life
I don't like my editor closing braces for me except for very specific cases.
We'll disable smartparens. How to do this is described in the [[https://discourse.doomemacs.org/t/disable-smartparens-or-parenthesis-completion/134][docs]].

*** TODO Set up leader / localleader
I'm not really sure that I like ~SPC m~ as localleader. I would prefer a single
key. In vim there are two open keys: ~\~ and ~SPC~. In Doom, ~\~ is taken, but I
may remap that. Another option is to use ~,~ as localleader.

** TODO Put everything in one org file
See [[https://zzamboni.org/post/my-doom-emacs-configuration-with-commentary/][this example config]].

** TODO Take many things from my native config
** TODO Language support
*** TODO C#
I have enabled C# lang mode in init.el, but there is config to be done / copied
from my old config, as well as in the current lang module. I may overwrite the
existing module, but if I can work from post-config, than that may be better.

Here's what needs to be done.

1. Add some config to csharp-mode-tree-sitter
2. Extract and publish eglot-csharp to github (or install with nix)
3. Evil-style bindings
4. Add LSP/eglot support to csharp-mode-tree-sitter

*** TODO TypeScript [0/3]
Typescript support is mostly built-in in Doom, but requires some extra setup.
Mainly to work with React.js / tsx. Here's a short TODO list.

- [ ] Add typescript langserver to nix config
- [ ] Add typescript langserver as eglot lsp server to typescript-tsx-mode
- [ ] Automagically start eglot when opening a tsx or ts file

These probably have to be added as additions to the ~web~ module, as that is
where React support is added.
** TODO Software support
*** Org mode
**** General things
We want some configuration of org-mode, because some of the defaults suck.
We start by setting the maximum text width to 80 columns.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org
  :config
  (add-hook! org-mode
    (setq fill-column 80)
    (auto-fill-mode t)))
#+end_src

We'll also make it start nicer, with correct indentation, better source code
highlighting and start folded.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org
  :config
  (setq org-startup-indented  t
        org-src-fontify-natively t
        org-startup-folded t))
#+end_src

I don't like Emacs' default tab handling, so I've changed it. Because of that,
we also need to change org's tab handling.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org
  :config
  (setq org-src-tab-acts-natively nil))
#+end_src

Finally I want slightly nicer key bindings for storing links and opening
agenda from org files.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(map!
 :mode org-mode
 :prefix "C-c"
 "a" #'org-agenda
 "l" #'org-store-link)
#+end_src

Formatting code blocks in org-mode is... finicky. We'll build our own formatting
function for code blocks.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun bvn/org-mode-indent-source ()
  (interactive)
  (org-edit-special)
  (evil-indent (point-min) (point-max))
  (org-edit-src-exit))

(map! :localleader
      :mode org-mode
      "=" #'bvn/org-mode-indent-source)
#+end_src

**** org-protocol
I use org-protocol, so it needs to be set up.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org
  :config (require 'org-protocol))
#+end_src

org-protocol is amazing for capturing things such as interesting websites to
read. Unfortunately, org-capture doesn't quite behave the way I want it to in
combination with org-protocol. Specifically it hardcodes where the buffer should
be placed, rather than using ~display-buffer~. This is annoying for several
reasons, but in this case I am only interested in the org-protocol case.

My desktop application wrapper assigns a name to the frame in which I'm
capturing with org-protocol. We check for that name when toggling
~org-capture-mode~ and if it matches we kill all other windows, forcing the
capture one to take the entire frame.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package! org
  :config
  (require 'org-protocol)

  (defvar org-protocol-capture-nest-level 0
    "Tracks capture level depth in org-protocol captures.")

    (let ((frame-name (cl-gensym "frame-name-")))
      `(let ((,frame-name (substring-no-properties
                           (cdr (assoc 'name (frame-parameters))))))
         (when (string-prefix-p "org-protocol-capture" ,frame-name)
           ,@body))))

  (add-hook! 'doom-switch-window-hook
    (bvn/in-org-protocol-capture-frame
     (when (and (string= "*doom*" (buffer-name (current-buffer)))
                (> (count-windows) 1))
